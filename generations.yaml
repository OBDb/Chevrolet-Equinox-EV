    description: "The Chevrolet Equinox EV is an all-electric compact crossover SUV that shares only its name with the gasoline-powered Equinox. Built on GM's Ultium EV platform, it features a sleek, aerodynamic design that's distinctly different from its combustion engine namesake, with a closed-off front grille, slim LED lighting elements, and a more futuristic overall appearance. The Equinox EV is offered in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations, with the former providing approximately 250 miles of range and the latter around 280 miles, depending on the battery pack and trim level. Power outputs range from roughly 210 HP in base front-wheel drive models to 290 HP in all-wheel drive variants. The interior showcases a modern, minimalist design centered around a standard 11-inch digital instrument cluster and 11-inch central touchscreen (upgraded to 17.7 inches in higher trims), with a floating center console providing additional storage space. Charging capabilities include DC fast charging at up to 150 kW, allowing approximately 70 miles of range to be added in 10 minutes. The Equinox EV is positioned as an affordable entry point to Chevrolet's electric vehicle lineup, with a starting price significantly lower than many competitors, making it a strategic model in GM's electrification plans. With its combination of practical size, competitive range, and accessible pricing, the Equinox EV aims to bring electric vehicles to mainstream compact SUV buyers who might otherwise consider traditional gasoline-powered alternatives."
